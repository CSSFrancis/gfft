This is commonly\r\nthe case in applications such as radio interferometry and medical imaging. \r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n\r\n  - Fast transformations between regular to regular, regular to irregular, \r\n    irregular to regular, and irregular to irregular spaces.\r\n  - Efficiently use with Hermitian symmetric data. One can store only half of \r\n    the data, and the symmetric data are implied.\r\n  - Handles mixtures of FFT and IFFT along different axes for multi-dimensional\r\n    data.\r\n  - Handles phase shifting of data for arbitrary axis definitions whether \r\n    zero-centered or centered at any other location along the input/output axes.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to the [GFFT Wiki](https://github.com/mrbell/gfft/wiki).\r\n\r\nGFFT is licensed under the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).\r\n","name":"GFFT","tagline":"A generalized FFT for Python that is able to handle data that is not stored on a regular grid.","google":""}
